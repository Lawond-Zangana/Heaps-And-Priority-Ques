# Heaps-And-Priority-Queues
- This project features the implementation of a minimum heap data structure, encapsulated within several key components. The `MinHeapInterface.java` defines the contract for the heap's operations, outlining methods for inserting elements, removing the minimum, and checking the size of the heap. The `MyMinHeap.java` class implements this interface, providing the underlying logic for managing the heap's array and ensuring the heap properties are maintained.
    
    The `MyPriorityQueue.java` class leverages the minimum heap to create a priority queue, which allows for efficient retrieval of the highest-priority element. `MyAlgorithm.java` likely contains algorithms that utilize the priority queue for various tasks, such as sorting or graph traversal. Finally, `PublicTester.java` serves as the testing suite, validating the functionality of the heap and priority queue through rigorous test cases. The project is documented in `README.md`, which provides an overview of the project structure, usage instructions, and implementation details.
